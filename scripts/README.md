# Automation Scripts

This directory will contain idempotent helpers for environment inspection,
image builds, cluster creation, deployment, validation, experiments, status,
rollback, and scoped cleanup.

Scripts must fail clearly, avoid broad destructive actions, inspect exact
targets, and support a dry-run or read-only mode where practical.
